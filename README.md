# Denoising-using-Compressed-Sensing-Algorithms

Used Dictionary learning algorithms such as KSVD and SimCO with Orathogonal matching pursuit to denoise images and compare them with traditional denoising algorithms such as mean, median, Gaussian filtering and TV Denoising using the **PSNR** and **SSIM** values Obtained
